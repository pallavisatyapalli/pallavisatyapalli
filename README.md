Hey there 🤗
I’m ***Pallavi, a CSE grad passionate about building real-world software and AI-driven solutions.
I specialize in Java, Python, SQL, and build efficient systems with MySQL, Git, and GitHub.
My focus areas include DSA, Operating Systems, Computer Networks, and frontend development.
I’m currently exploring Gen AI, ML fundamentals, and AI-powered full-stack applications.
I’ve built projects like StudySphere, HMS, and several AI-based tools.
And I’m constantly creating, improving, and shipping new ideas.
